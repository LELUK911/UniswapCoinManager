Documentation for UniswapAndTokenManager
Overview

The UniswapAndTokenManager contract integrates Uniswap V3, WETH, and a custom ERC20 token to manage liquidity pools. This contract demonstrates how to create a Uniswap V3 pool, add liquidity, and handle minting and swapping operations using Uniswap V3 callbacks. It employs secure coding practices using OpenZeppelin libraries and restricts access using the Ownable pattern.
Features

    Custom Token Management:
        Dynamically set a custom ERC20 token address.
        Add liquidity with custom token and WETH.

    Uniswap V3 Pool Integration:
        Create Uniswap V3 pools with customizable parameters.
        Add initial liquidity to pools.
        Handle mint and swap callbacks automatically.

    Security:
        Implements SafeERC20 for secure token transfers.
        Restricts sensitive operations to the contract owner.

Events

    TokenDeployed:
        Triggered when the token address is set.
        Parameters:
            tokenAddress: The address of the custom token.
            mintedBalance: The total balance minted.

    PoolCreated:
        Triggered when a new Uniswap V3 pool is created and funded.
        Parameters:
            pool: The address of the pool.
            amount1: Amount of token1 added to the pool.
            amount2: Amount of token2 added to the pool.

Key Functions
Public Functions

    setTokenAddress(address _tokenAddress):
        Sets the custom ERC20 token address.
        Access: onlyOwner.

    createNewPool(uint ethForPool, uint tokenForPool):
        Creates a Uniswap V3 pool with initial liquidity.
        Access: onlyOwner.

    uniswapV3MintCallback(uint256 amount0Owed, uint256 amount1Owed, bytes calldata data):
        Handles the callback when liquidity is minted in the pool.
        Transfers owed WETH and custom token amounts to the pool.

    uniswapV3SwapCallback(int256 amount0Delta, int256 amount1Delta, bytes calldata data):
        Handles the callback during swaps in the pool.
        Transfers owed token amounts to the pool.

Internal Functions

    _createAndFundUniswapPool(uint ethForPool, uint tokenForPool):
        Internal function to calculate the initial price, create the Uniswap pool, and fund it.

    _createUniswapPool(uint160 sqrtPriceX96, uint ethForPool, uint tokenForPool):
        Creates a Uniswap V3 pool and initializes it with the specified price.

    _fundUniswapPool(address pool, uint256 tokenAmountForLiquidity, uint256 ethForLiquidity, uint160 sqrtPriceX96):
        Adds liquidity to the created Uniswap pool.

    _calculateSqrtPriceX96(uint _amount0, uint _amount1):
        Calculates the square root of the price ratio in X96 format for initializing the pool.

    _sqrt(uint256 y):
        Calculates the square root of a given number using the Babylonian method.

Deployment Instructions

    Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/uniswap-and-token-manager.git
cd uniswap-and-token-manager
```
Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Deploy the contract using Hardhat:
```
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mainnet
```
Usage
1. Set Token Address

Use the setTokenAddress function to define the custom ERC20 token address:
```
setTokenAddress(0xYourTokenAddress);
```
2. Create a Pool

Create a Uniswap V3 pool with specified amounts of WETH and the custom token:
```
createNewPool(1 ether, 1000000 * 1e18);
```
3. Handle Callbacks

Uniswap V3 automatically invokes uniswapV3MintCallback and uniswapV3SwapCallback during pool interactions.
